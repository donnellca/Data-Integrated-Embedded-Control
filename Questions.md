Questions:
 - What other nonlinearity measures exist
 - Is there an equivalent of k-means clustering the affine transformation for the continuous flow of the nonlinear system?
 - Why make the transformations affine (linear with respect to the triangle centroid) rather than linear with respect to the origin
   - The non-displaced transformation won't be exact (least squares solution)
   - But we're already linearizing a nonlinear system, and therefore require it to cover a small area anyway (exact solution is a false sense of security)
